Lab 10 Objectives:

- Correlation matrices
- Binary logistic regression
- Dates/times with lubridate
- Heatmap of solar irradiation in Santa Barbara, Hilo (HI), and Fairbanks (AK) in 2010
- Aquaculture with gganimate

# PART 0. Load libraries
```{r packages}
library(tidyverse) # The tidyverse!
library(corrplot) # For correlation matrices
library(janitor) # For cleaning up column names
library(lubridate) # For dealing with dates & times
library(gganimate) # For adding animation to ggplot graphics
library(ggimage) # For updating graph components with images
```

# PART 1. Correlation matrix (World Bank world environmental factors data)

Compiled World Bank data, accessed from: https://www.kaggle.com/zanderventer/environmental-variables-for-world-countries#World_countries_env_vars.csv

- Read in the "world_env_vars.csv file" as env_var
- Find correlations between all variables, columns 2:28
- Plot the correlation matrix (corrplot)

```{r env_corr}

env_var <- read_csv("world_env_vars.csv") %>% 
  na.omit #omit NA values - DONT DO THIS WITHOUT EXPLORING DATA FIRST

cor_df <- cor(env_var[2:28]) #use this to show correlation between all variables in column 2-28

corrplot(cor_df, type = "upper", method = "ellipse",
         tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.5) #type just shows one-half, method shows shapes, tl is for color and size of text 
```

# PART 2. Binary Logistic Regression (Donner Party Data)

Use the 'glm' function for fitting *generalized linear models* (the *logit* - log odds of survival, in our case, will be linearly related to Sex and Age. So we expect the final model to look something like this: 

$$Log Odds (Survival) = \beta_0 + \beta_1(Age) + \beta_2(Sex)$$

We'll use 'family = binomial' to run binomial logistic regression...otherwise, this looks very similar to other types of regression we've already done. 

a. Read in the DonnerTable.csv file as DonnerTable

```{r donner_data}
```

b. Binomial logistic regression

```{r blr}
```

c. Use the model to answer: What are the log odds of survival for a 5 year-old female? The probability of survival?

```{r predict_f_5}
# 1. Create a data frame with variables Sex and Age, containing data "Female" and 5, respectively: 
# 2. Find the log odds of survival for the new data (5 year old female) using predict() function with type = "link":
# 3. Exponentiate the log odds to find ODDS of survival for a 5 year old female:
# Ask: Could we manually find the probability of survival for a 5-year old female? recall: p/(1-p) = ODDS
# 4. Actually, let's just use type = "response" in the predict function, which converts to a probability for us:
```

d. What is the probability of survival for a 25 year-old male? 

```{r predict_m_25}
# Similarly:
m_25 <- data.frame(Sex = "Male", Age = 25) # Make a new data frame
m_25_prob <- predict(donner_blr, newdata = m_25, type = "response") # Find probability of survival
m_25_prob
```

e. Create new sequences of data so that we can graph probabilities for the entire spectrum of ages, designated by sex.

```{r new_data}
seq_age <- rep(seq(from = 0, to = 100), 2) # Create a sequence from 0 to 100, twice (one will be "Male" and one will be "Female")
f_101 <- rep("Female", 101) # Repeat 'Female' 101 times (to match years data)
m_101 <- rep("Male", 101) # Repeat 'Male' 101 times
mf_101 <- c(f_101, m_101) # Combine them into a single vector
# Combine the age and sex sequences into a single data frame - that will be the new data that we have our model make predictions for
donner_newdata <- data.frame(seq_age, mf_101) # MUST make column names match variables in the model!
colnames(donner_newdata) <- c("Age","Sex")
```

f. Now that we have new data to put into our model to have it make predictions, let's go ahead and actually find the predicted probabilities for each Age/Sex combination.

```{r donner_predict}
# Find probabilities using predict (with type = "response"). Include SE.
# Coerce outcome into data frame. 
```

g. Graph results.

```{r donner_graph}
  
```


# PART 3. Solar irradiation at the 3 locations in 2010 (pull in all together, do some lubridate stuff, etc.)

a. Read in multiple solar irradiation files (for SB (CA), Hilo (HI), and Fairbanks (AK)):
```{r solar_data}
```

b. Wrangle the data
```{r wrangle_solar}
```

c. Use lubridate() functions to convert to times/dates
```{r date_time}
```

d. Make an awesome figure of solar irradiation (heat/tile map)
```{r solar_graph}
```


#PART 4. gganimate example: total aquaculture production (metric tons) for United States, Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador

a. Get the data, and do some wrangling:
```{r aqua_data}
```


b. Read in the fish.png as 'fish'

```{r fish_image}
```

c. Make a graph...with gganimate!
```{r gganimate_fish}
```
